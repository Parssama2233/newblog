CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools. But when should you use each? Let's explore their strengths and use cases.
## 🔍 The Key Difference

- **Flexbox**: One-dimensional layouts (row OR column)
- **Grid**: Two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)

## 🧰 Flexbox: Best For

### 🧭 1. Navigation Bars

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 🃏 2. Card Layouts

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### 🎯 3. Centering Content

```css
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## 🏗️ Grid: Best For

### 📄 1. Page Layouts

```css
.page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}
```

### 🖼️ 2. Gallery Layouts

```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### 🧾 3. Complex Forms

```css
.form {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: max-content 1fr;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## 🤝 Can They Work Together?

Absolutely! Use Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for component details.

```css
/* Grid for page structure */
.app {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

/* Flexbox for header content */
.header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## ⚡ Quick Decision Guide

Use **Flexbox** when:
- Content flows in one direction
- You need equal height columns
- You want to align items along one axis

Use **Grid** when:
- You need precise control over rows AND columns
- Creating complex layouts
- Working with overlapping elements

## 🌐 Browser Support

Both have excellent support in modern browsers. For older browsers:
- Flexbox: IE11 with prefixes
- Grid: No IE11 support

## ✅ Conclusion

Don't think of Grid vs Flexbox as competitors. They're complementary tools in your CSS toolkit. Master both and use them where they excel!
