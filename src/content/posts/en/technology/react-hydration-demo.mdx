import DemoCounter from '@components/islands/DemoCounter';

Astro treats every page as static HTML by default, but you can opt-in to client-side
interactivity by hydrating framework components on demand. This article embeds the new
`<DemoCounter />` React component directly inside markdown content so you can see the
experience your readers get.

## 🏝️ Hydrated React Island

The counter below hydrates immediately on page load thanks to the `client:load`
directive. Change the step size, click the buttons, and watch the state update in real
time—the markup started static, and React now manages it in the browser.

<DemoCounter client:load initial={3} />

### ⚙️ How It Works

- We installed the React integration (`@astrojs/react`) and enabled it in the Astro config.
- MDX support (`@astrojs/mdx`) lets us import framework components straight into content
  files like this one.
- The component lives in `src/components/islands/DemoCounter/`, exposing metadata for the
  automatic registry and using regular React hooks.

Because islands only hydrate when instructed, you can mix fast static content with
dynamic experiences without turning the whole page into an SPA. Try scrolling away and
back again—the component stays interactive because React is now in control of just that
fragment.
