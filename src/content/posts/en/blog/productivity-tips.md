Being productive as a developer isn't just about writing more code. It's about working smarter, not harder. Here are 10 tips that have transformed my workflow.
## ⌨️ 1. Master Your Keyboard

Stop reaching for the mouse! Learn keyboard shortcuts for:
- Your IDE/editor
- Terminal commands
- Operating system navigation

Time saved: **30+ minutes daily**

## 🚀 2. Use Alfred/Raycast (Mac) or PowerToys (Windows)

Launcher apps are game-changers:
- Quick app switching
- Snippet expansion
- Clipboard history
- Quick calculations

## ⏱️ 3. Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused 25-minute sprints:
1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Take a 5-minute break
3. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break

## 🤖 4. Automate Repetitive Tasks

If you do it more than twice, automate it:
- Shell scripts for common workflows
- Git aliases for frequent commands
- Snippets for boilerplate code

## 🙅 5. Learn to Say No

Your time is valuable. Protect it:
- Decline unnecessary meetings
- Batch similar tasks
- Set boundaries for deep work time

## 🧠 6. Use a Second Brain

Don't rely on memory:
- Document solutions to problems
- Keep a learning journal
- Use tools like Notion or Obsidian

## 🛋️ 7. Optimize Your Environment

### 🪑 Physical Space
- Good chair and desk
- Proper lighting
- Minimal distractions

### 💻 Digital Space
- Clean desktop
- Organized project folders
- Efficient window management

## 📈 8. Practice Incremental Improvements

Small daily improvements compound:
- Learn one new shortcut per week
- Refactor one piece of code daily
- Read 10 pages of technical content

## 🧘 9. Take Regular Breaks

Productivity isn't about non-stop work:
- Stand up every hour
- Look away from screen (20-20-20 rule)
- Take walking breaks

## 📚 10. Invest in Learning

Stay sharp and motivated:
- Follow industry trends
- Learn new technologies
- Contribute to open source

## 🗓️ Bonus: My Daily Routine

```
6:00 AM - Wake up, review goals
6:30 AM - Deep work session (no distractions)
9:00 AM - Check messages, meetings
12:00 PM - Lunch break + walk
1:00 PM - Collaborative work
3:00 PM - Code reviews, documentation
5:00 PM - Learning time
6:00 PM - Done for the day!
```

Remember: Productivity is personal. Experiment with these tips and find what works for you!
